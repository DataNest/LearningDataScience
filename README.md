# Learning Data Science 

In this repository, I'll keep the code I write as I learn about Data Science. 

I write about what I am learning here:

For all notebooks which require a GPU (anything which includes Keras or Tensorflow), I use an [AWS P2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/). 

## 
I approached the projects in the following order: 

1. **Image Recognition**
    In this project, I build a neural network in Keras to identify invasive plant species in images, as part of Kaggle's [Invasive Species Monitoring](https://www.kaggle.com/c/invasive-species-monitoring) competition.
