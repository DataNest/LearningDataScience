# Learning Data Science 

In this repository, I'll keep the code I write as I learn about Data Science. 

I write about what I am learning here:

For all notebooks which require a GPU (anything which includes Keras or Tensorflow), I use an [AWS P2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/). 

## 
I approached the projects in the following order: 
1. Machine Learning - Titanic
2. Image Recognition
3. Recommender System 
4. Natural Language Processing
5. Style Neural Network 
6. Timeseries data
